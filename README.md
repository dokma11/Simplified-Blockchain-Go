This project is designed to facilitate learning and understanding of blockchain technology by implementing it from scratch in Go. Inspired by [Jeiwanâ€™s guide](https://jeiwan.net/posts/building-blockchain-in-go-part-1/), it serves as a hands-on exploration of core blockchain concepts such as proof-of-work, transactions, blocks, cryptographic hashing, and distributed consensus. The goal is to gain a deeper insight into how decentralized systems operate while reinforcing Go programming skills.
